Airflow architecture is generally divided into two types: 

1) single-node architecture (Single machine)
2) multi-node architecture (Network of machines)


However, before moving to Airflow architecture visualization, you should be aware that a running instance of Airflow has a number of Daemons that work together to provide the full functionality of Airflow.

The daemons include the Web Server, Scheduler, Worker and others.
