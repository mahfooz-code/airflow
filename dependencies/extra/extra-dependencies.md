# The apache-airflow PyPI basic package only installs what’s needed to get started. 
Additional packages can be installed depending on what will be useful in your environment.
For instance, if you don’t need connectivity with Postgres, you won’t have to go through the trouble of installing the postgres-devel yum package.
Most of the extra dependencies are linked to a corresponding provider package.
